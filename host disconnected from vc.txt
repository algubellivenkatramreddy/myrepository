1)The reason for the host to non-responsive was due to host not able to access the storage.
The host is designed to stop the hostd service once it not able to process the i/o's and perform any read/write operation on datastore.
The hostd service went un-responsive after multiple try from host to connect to storage and once hostd stopped the host disconnected from vCenter.


Below mentioned host went to not responding state on 2019-02-15 Time 21:31:34.
We have checked with VMware for root cause, they found it naa.60000970000197000397533030444534 it reached high i/o not able to perform read/write operations on data store.
That the reason Hostd service stopped on host and it went not responding from vcenter.

2)
Below Pillars are HDD Firmware Excluded in firmware package, so when we had done UCSM firmware upgrade to 4.0, 
Below mentioned Pillars HDD firmware had been missed (as HDD Excluded at the time of environment configurations)
So Cisco recommended to upgrade to only HDD firmware upgrade after they reviewed logs and now we are in progress.
Pillar01
Pillar02 (upgraded HHD firmware in one of the rack mounts in pillar02 (p02h09 host) So far not seen any errors
Pillar05 
Pillar06
Pillar07

HDD Firmware not Excluded in firmware package: 
Pillar03 
Pillar04
So whenever we have done cisco UCSM firmware upgrade to 4.0(1) HDD drivers Firmware also had been upgraded.
So HDD Firmware also upgrade to new version here (GXT51F3Q)

WebEx summary:
===============
+ Previous engineer suggested to upgrade firmware on the server to upgrade the Hard Drive firmware
+ Have verified the domain P04H0X and found that all the rack-servers are already in 4.0(1) firmware and even hard drives firmware are upgraded to GXT51F3Q
+ This environment is already running in fixed release according to the bug CSCvj90575 which is provided by previous engineer
+ On Domain P02H09 rack-server are still in 3.2(2b) firmware and Hard-drive firmware is 0F3Q, previous engineer analyzed the logs and provided the bug for the same domain

So I would request you to upgrade the firmware to 3.2(3e) on Server 9 of domain P02H09 and make sure Hard Drives firmware’s are upgraded.
Since domain P04H0X is already in fixed release, I would request you to engage VMware team to look into this domain hosts and check if they are still seeing any PSOD issue.”
