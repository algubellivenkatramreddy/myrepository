Below are the steps I used to copy the file from windows server to our appliance
1.	Enable SSH on the appliance, if you changed the default.
2.	Login via SSH: root
3.	Type your root password (often the same PW as your vCenter admin)
4.	shell.set –enabled True
5.	shell
6.	chsh -s /bin/bash root
7.	chsh -s /bin/appliancesh root
