1. Navigate to the installation media and edit the boot.cfg file. Replace
kernelopt=runweasel with kernelopt=runweasel ks=usb:/ks.cfg. This
allows the system to automatically use the script located on the USB drive. Make
sure you use an editor that can handle UNIX encoding.
2. Create a ks.cfg file in the root directory of the USB device that the installer will
use for the unattended installation. Edit the file and create the script. You can use
the following simple script as an example:
vmaccepteula
rootpw mypassword
install --firstdisk –overwritevmfs
keyboard English
network --bootproto=dhcp --device=vmnic0
reboot
3. Save and close the file. Plug in the USB stick and power on the server.
4. To manually run the installer script when the ESXi installer window appears,
press Shift + O to edit boot options. At the runweasel command line, type
ks=usb:/ks.cfg. To specify the path to an installation script, you may also use
the command ks=http://ip_address/kickstart/ks.cfg, where the IP
address refers to the machine where the script resides.
